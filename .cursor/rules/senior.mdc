# Cursor Rules for This Repository
This repository must maintain a clean, professional, open-source–grade codebase.  
Cursor must follow these rules for **all interactions, generations, reviews, and refactors**.

---

## 1. General Engineering Principles
- Always act as a **senior software engineer** with expertise in React, TypeScript, clean architecture, and OSS quality.
- Code must be clean, readable, modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Prefer **composition over duplication**.
- Never introduce unnecessary abstractions or complexity.
- Follow functional programming principles where applicable.

---

## 2. JavaScript → TypeScript Migration Rules
- The project is being migrated from **JavaScript to TypeScript**.
- The user may provide JS files — **Cursor must rewrite them into clean TypeScript**, with:
  - Proper interfaces/types
  - Strong typing (no `any` unless absolutely necessary)
  - Organized folder placement
  - Clearer component architecture
- All new files must be generated in **TypeScript only**.

---

## 3. File & Folder Structure Rules
Always structure code into:

- `components/` → small reusable UI components  
- `sections/` → large page sections (Hero, Features, etc.)
- `layouts/` → global layouts or wrappers  
- `hooks/` → custom React hooks  
- `lib/` → utilities, helpers, constants  
- `styles/` → global styles or theme config  
- `assets/` → images, icons, SVGs  
- `config/` → site configuration  
- `types/` → shared TypeScript types/interfaces  
- `pages/` or `app/` → top-level routing  

Whenever the user provides a file, **place it into the correct folder** and suggest improvements if needed.

---

## 4. React & Code Quality Rules
- Only use **TypeScript** + React functional components.
- Use **arrow functions** and **named exports**.
- Prefer absolute imports when supported.
- Components must be:
  - Pure  
  - Readable  
  - Minimal  
  - Small  
  - Well-structured  
- No:
  - Inline styles (unless trivial)
  - Magic numbers/strings
  - Long unbroken JSX blocks (extract components)
  - Duplicate logic
- Always break complex components into logical subcomponents.

---

## 5. Styling Rules
- Use TailwindCSS (if present in the project).
- Keep classNames short and readable.
- Use theme variables instead of hardcoded colors.
- Avoid repeated utility classes — create reusable patterns or components when needed.

---

## 6. Refactor & Review Rules
When the user provides any file:
- Review it like a senior engineer doing a code review.
- Identify anti-patterns, smells, and optimization opportunities.
- Suggest and apply improvements:
  - Better naming  
  - Cleaner logic  
  - Reduced nesting  
  - Better structure  
  - Dead code removal  
  - Stronger typing  
- Ensure proper accessibility and semantic HTML.
- Ensure responsive design patterns.

Unless the user says “review only,” always return a **cleaned, modern, TypeScript version**.

---

## 7. Documentation Rules
- Use JSDoc/TS docblocks for important functions and utilities.
- Avoid unnecessary comments — the code should explain itself.
- Only annotate when clarity increases.

---

## 8. When the User Says “Improve This File”
Cursor must automatically:
- Clean the code
- Convert to TypeScript
- Place it in the correct folder
- Improve naming & typings
- Refactor into smaller parts if needed
- Fix logic, patterns, accessibility, and readability
- Produce an open-source–quality version

---

## 9. Communication Rules
When responding:
1. Output **only the improved, final TypeScript code**.
2. Provide a short summary of what was improved.
3. Suggest structural improvements if needed.

Do NOT:
- Add new dependencies unless explicitly requested.
- Change the UI appearance unless it improves readability or reduces code noise.

---

## 10. Priorities
- Cleanest possible code  
- Best folder structure  
- Strongest type safety  
- Professional open-source quality  
- Maximum readability and maintainability  

These rules apply to **every generation in this repository**.
