# Cursor Rules for This Repository
The goal of this repository is to maintain a clean, professional, open-source grade codebase.  
Cursor must follow these rules across all interactions, generations, refactors, and reviews.

---

## 1. General Principles
- Always act as a **senior software engineer** with expertise in React, TypeScript, clean architecture, and open-source patterns.
- All code should be clean, readable, modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Prefer **composition over duplication**.
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate.
- Avoid any unnecessary complexity or abstraction.

---

## 2. File & Folder Structure
Always enforce:
- `components/` → small, reusable, stateless UI components  
- `sections/` → page-level UI sections (Hero, Features, CTA, etc.)
- `layouts/` → global layouts or wrappers  
- `hooks/` → custom React hooks  
- `lib/` → utilities, helpers, constants  
- `styles/` → global styles or theme config  
- `assets/` → images, svgs, icons  
- `config/` → site metadata, constants  
- `types/` → TypeScript interfaces and types  
- `pages/` or `app/` → top-level routing (depending on React/Next)

Whenever user provides a file, restructure it to fit this optimal layout.

---

## 3. React & Code Quality Rules
- Always use **TypeScript** for every new file.
- Use **arrow functions**, React functional components, and named exports only.
- Use **absolute imports** where the project structure supports it.
- Strictly follow clean component architecture:
  - Component should be **pure**
  - No inline styles (unless tiny)
  - No magic numbers or strings
  - No deeply nested JSX – extract components
- Always break big components into smaller readable units.

---

## 4. Styling Rules
- Use TailwindCSS (if the project uses it).  
- Keep classNames minimal and readable.
- No random colors — follow a centralized theme.
- No copy-pasted repetitive classes — create utilities when needed.

---

## 5. Refactoring Rules
Whenever the user shares a file:
- Review it like a senior engineer doing a code review.
- Identify issues, smells, anti-patterns, optimizations.
- Suggest restructuring, renaming, or splitting logic.
- Rewrite the code in **your best, open-source quality style**, unless asked only to review.
- Ensure accessibility (aria tags, semantic HTML).
- Ensure responsiveness.

---

## 6. Documentation Rules
- Add JSDoc or TS docblocks for important functions.
- Add inline comments only when needed.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; code should explain itself.

---

## 7. When user says “improve this file”
Automatically do:
- Cleanup
- Better folder placement
- Type safety improvements
- Remove dead code
- Fix naming conventions
- Improve logic flow
- Improve readability
- Ensure consistency

---

## 8. Communication Rules
When the user sends a file:
1. Output the **cleaned, refactored code**.
2. Provide a **short explanation** of what was improved.
3. Suggest further structural improvements if needed.

Do NOT:
- Add unnecessary dependencies.
- Change visual UI unless improving readability or reducing noise.

---

## 9. Priority
Cleanest code.  
Best possible file structure.  
Perfect readability.  
Open-source polish.

These rules apply to ALL generations inside this repo.
